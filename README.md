# Chicago Census Data SQL Queries

I worked with three datasets that are available on the City of Chicago’s Data Portal to run a number of SQL queries including joins statements, creating a view, creating a stored procedure, and using a transaction. Description of the datasets are:

1-Socioeconomic indicators in Chicago
This dataset contains a selection of six socioeconomic indicators of public health significance and a “hardship index,” for each Chicago community area, for the years 2008 – 2012. A detailed description of this dataset and the original dataset can be obtained from the Chicago Data Portal at:

2-Chicago public schools
This dataset shows all school level performance data used to create CPS School Report Cards for the 2011-2012 school year. A detailed description of this dataset and the original dataset can be obtained from the Chicago Data Portal at:

3-Chicago crime data
This dataset reflects reported incidents of crime (with the exception of murders where data exists for each victim) that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2001 to present, minus the most recent seven days. A detailed description of this dataset and the original dataset can be obtained from the Chicago Data Portal at: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2
